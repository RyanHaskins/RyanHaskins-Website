      <p class="cv-content"> I first discovered my passion for computers and IT when i joined the BF company where i currently work as a office assistant in the IT department.
      It has allowed me to get a feel of computers and what IT is all about.
      After working there for 4 months i realised this was the area i want to specialise in so i decided to start a university degree in IT inorder to enhance my knowledge and to practice the skills i learn there.
      I have been offering IT support assistance to the company for almost a year.
      I have also done voluntary work for a food company which involved me wiping the computer hard drives inorder to get the computers ready for donation.
      I have been learning HTML and have now created my own website.
      This has also given me good experience with using Github.
      I am currently in my first year at university.</p>
