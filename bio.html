      <p class="bio-content">I have a lot of various hobbies that go from the bog standard seeing friends and watching sports to going snowboarding and taking on different challanges in an attempt to better myself.
      I have taken on many different challanges through work which involve being mentally and physically strong.
      Not only do i love keeping fit and challangeing myself i enjoy playing fantasy games with friends because it allows my imagination to run riot.
      I will always enjoy playing cricket i have been playing since i was 11 and it is still a huge passion of mine.
      I also enjoy creating things i found myself creating spreadsheets which would update automatically when i entered a result just so i could keep statistics when playing video games. I have to confess, i do enjoy the odd video game from time to time.
      I spend a lot of my free time watching films, reading books and watching animes aswell.
      All in all i enjoy a lot of different activities so i am very open to trying new activities out. </p>
      <h2 class="bio-content"> Personality:</h2>
      <p class="bio-content"> I'm a very bubble energetic person once i open up.
      I can be quite shy as well.
      I believe my personality can be summed up as being quite quirky.
      I believe that the best way to really know someones personality is simple spending time with them so you can make your own assumption.</p>
      <h2 class="bio-content"> Aspirations:</h2>
      <p class="bio-content"> My aspirations are quite simple really.
      For starters i am aiming to find a job that i love doing and look foward to each day becasuse then i can use my ambition to give something back to the company.
      On the other side of the fence i would love a family and to have my own place too.
      I would really like to go exploring, so i would like to travel a bit and see different countries around the world. </p>
