Theory behind the website: 

Text: i wanted to make sure the information throughout the website was clear and easy to read this is why i went with a standard font of Arial
and also why i chose to keep the font colour black as this colour stands out the most. The reason why i used sans-serif as my back up option for
the content is simply because its compatible with the majority if not all the web browsers. 

Images: because i wanted to keep the website looking clear and easily readable i haven't used a lot of pictures. I believe too many pictures 
distract the user from the important information on the page. With this in mind having just text throughout the website can be very dull and users
will get bored with just plain text throughout. I have used only a small amount of images per page with the intent to fill up spare space and to 
make the page more decorative for viewers. The reason why i chose the pictures i did? The main picture on the home page i was set on a stick figure 
because it helps show the website is about a person. This means the picture is relevant. I didn't see the point of using a random person or a well
known person as a replacement because then the website should be relatable to that person. A stick figure isn't any single person but can be used
as a representation of somebody. This means i can relate the website about myself without having to use a picture of myself. I used the superhero 
image to represent a drive to improve which i spoke about on the CV page. I chose this because i felt it represented a motivational type of image. 
I used this picture because it wasn't a normal type of image and it helped to make the page more attractive and brought a lot more colour onto the 
page without it being too distracting. I chose not to use any images on the Bio page because i didn't think it was necessary  

Navigation bar: For the majority of the project i had the navigation bar directly above the website title. It looked tidy and clear but i wanted to 
add a quirky unique touch to the website which was subtle. With this in mind i tried to offset the navigation bar with the website title. I believe 
it accomplishes the purpose of adding my own touch to the website. 

Website title: The website title font was from the Google API Webfonts. I chose the Teko font because i wanted the website to be easy to read. This
font offered a simplistic style. The font is different but not too artistic that makes it hard to read. The font also helps bold blocked letters 
standout that is why i chose to use it for the title. I wanted the main content text to be all the same.
I got the idea of having the header and footer all the way across the page frol the Joel.sh website which was created by Joel. In order to be able to
manipulate the content on the 

Website design: i wanted to keep it simple so i went with a white background as it makes the black text easy to read. I also decided to use a light
colour for the footer and header so it doesn't feel so in your face and the blue colours don't stand out so much. The light blue blends well with white.

static form: To create the static form on the contact me page i used Tom Rose's HTML Form Example.

What worked well and what didn't:

Main Positives: 

Firstly my favourite part of this site is the header and everything in it. It looks simple but the styling and black text is complimented by the light blue
background. I really like how this looks and how the navigation bar is offset to the title. I did originally have them alligned so they were nicely centred 
but i didn't think it looked as good as being offset. I made sure the title was under the CV part of the navigation bar so they did slightly overlap. 

Another part of the site i like the most is how clear and easy everything is to read and where each piece of information is placed. I really liked the idea of having the index page combine as a content page
this helps people know straight away what pages stores what information. I got this idea from Joel.sh website which is refrenced below but also available here: https://joel.sh/.

The last main positive i wanted to talk about with this site is that i didn't want to go over the top with the images so i put images in when needed and when appropriate so the pages didn't look so 
clustered. 

Main negatives: 

To me i liked the idea of the website being simple and clear but i think it may not have enough eye catching features that gets people more intrigued in the site.
This could be done with more colour but i would need to test a few colours first to see what goes well with light blue otherwise it would make the page look bizzarre as if it is out of place if the colours don't match each other. 
I could have also done this with addign a few more icons. The only place i would have implemented this would have been on the index page next to each sub headings but i'm still happy how the page looks without the icons there. 

Another improvement i could have made is to use a different font or colour than the basic font. This would have been done by changing the font-family in the appropriate class. When i first seen the content i was happy with how it 
looked so didn't think i needed to change it.


Creation of the website: 

1 hour: I viewed the Joel.sh website and using this i created the wireframes for my website. The Wirefranes show the layout of how i wanted the website to
look. I probably should have thought about the colour but because i knew i was using a white background and black text there wasn't much colour to be added.
When i put the footer and header in the wireframes i thought the light blue would compliment the text and bring a bit of colour which was missing to the website. 

30 mins: It took about half an hour to set up the repository and make the folder layout. I made a mistake and deleted previous commits because i wanted to start a fresh. This did mean i lost 
previous commits but i made the numbers up throughout creating the website. The reason for deleting the previous stuff was because i'm hoping to add other 
content and i wanted to make sure everything was professional and ordered. This wasn't the case when i was getting used to using GitHub.

15 mins: To lay out the basic code of each of the page so i had the footer and the header put in with a bit of content so that i could see where the paragraphs was showing.
This was to check that the header and footer were set up correctly.

30 mins: Took me to design and work learn how to create the navigation bar and implement it. I decided to use a horzontal list and none bullet pointed due to looking at Joel.sh home page.
The position of the navigation bar was my idea. i used this W3schools page available here: http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp to get the navigation bar functioning.

1 hour: To implement images on each page. This includes finding the images as i didn't want to use any images that were of me i decided to pull off some copyright free images from Pixabay. 
These images are references below. I added a div to each picture so i could make changes to each picture on its own. 

1 hour: once i got all the images in place and looking the way i wanted them too it took me another hour to fill the pages with the right content and to style this as with everything on my page i have 
covered everything on the site in divs so if i weren't happy with a small issue with a picture i can just change that div and it will change just that picture which is much easier than not using divs and using one class 
for all the images. 

30 mins: After the content was put in it took me another 30 mins to check the content and all the styling that i was happy with it. 

40 mins: Put in place the static form i had to refer back to Tom Rose static form on this one and which is refrenced below but can be found here: http://codepen.io/UoN-ThomasRose/pen/NbYrGj. I had a lot of small adjustments to make sure the 
spacing was equal between the lines. This is were one of the bigger issues i have had with the website has come in play. Something i would like to do is change the "Email me here." title to be slightly higher up in the box which would close the gap between
itself and the boarder line but everything i played with didn't like it i reckon if i made a seperate class for the title it might have worked as i could see if the margin or padding was an issue with it. When i changed the padding on the static form the problem 
was still there. This is one improvement i would make to the website.  

Hours taken: 5:25 (this is constant working on it.)
