Theory behind the website: 

Text: i wanted to make sure the information throughout the website was clear and easy to read this is why i went with a standard font of Arial
and also why i chose to keep the font colour black as this colour stands out the most. The reason why i used sans-serif as my back up option for
the content is simply because its compatible with the majority if not all the web browsers. 

Images: because i wanted to keep the website looking clear and easily readable i haven't used a lot of pictures. I believe too many pictures 
distract the user from the important information on the page. With this in mind having just text throughout the website can be very dull and users
will get bored with just plain text throughout. I have used only a small amount of images per page with the intent to fill up spare space and to 
make the page more decorative for viewers. The reason why i chose the pictures i did? The main picture on the home page i was set on a stick figure 
because it helps show the website is about a person. This means the picture is relevant. I didn't see the point of using a random person or a well
known person as a replacement because then the website should be relatable to that person. A stick figure isn't any single person but can be used
as a representation of somebody. This means i can relate the website about myself without having to use a picture of myself. I used the superhero 
image to represent a drive to improve which i spoke about on the CV page. I chose this because i felt it represented a motivational type of image. 
I used this picture because it wasn't a normal type of image and it helped to make the page more attractive and brought a lot more colour onto the 
page without it being too distracting. I chose not to use any images on the Bio page because i didn't think it was necessary  

Navigation bar: For the majority of the project i had the navigation bar directly above the website title. It looked tidy and clear but i wanted to 
add a quirky unique touch to the website which was subtle. With this in mind i tried to offset the navigation bar with the website title. I believe 
it accomplishes the purpose of adding my own touch to the website. 

Website title: The website title font was from the Google API Webfonts. I chose the Teko font because i wanted the website to be easy to read. This
font offered a simplistic style. The font is different but not too artistic that makes it hard to read. The font also helps bold blocked letters 
standout that is why i chose to use it for the title. I wanted the main content text to be all the same.

Website design: i wanted to keep it simple so i went with a white background as it makes the black text easy to read. I also decided to use a light
colour for the footer and header so it doesn't feel so in your face and the blue colours don't stand out so much. The light blue blends well with white.

static form: To create the static form on the contact me page i used Tom Rose's HTML Form Example.
