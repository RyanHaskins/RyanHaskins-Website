Theory behind the website: 

Text: I wanted to make sure the information throughout the website was clear and easy to read. I went with a standard font and the font colour black as this stands out the most. The reason why i used sans-serif as my back up option is because it’s compatible with most web browsers. 

Images: I wanted to keep the website looking clear and readable so I didn’t use many pictures. I believe too many pictures distract the user from the information on the page. I used images where I thought they were necessary and helped improve the look of the page. The home page image was of a stick figure because it helped show the website is about a person without having to use a picture of myself. I didn't want to use other people as a well-known person because then people would expect the website to be related to that person. A stick figure isn't any single person but can be used as a representation of somebody. This means i can relate the website about myself without having to use a picture of myself. 

Navigation bar: For the majority of the project i had the navigation bar directly above the website title. It looked tidy and clear but i wanted to add a quirky unique touch to the website. With this in mind i tried to offset the navigation bar with the website title. I believe it accomplishes the purpose of adding my own touch to the website. 

Website title: The website title font was from the Google API Webfonts. I chose the Teko font because i wanted the website to be easy to read as well as attractive. This font offered a simplistic but attractive style. The font is different but not too artistic which could make it hard to read.

Website Structure: I got the idea of having the header and footer all the way across the page from the Joel.sh website which was created by Joel. In order to be able to manipulate the content throughout the website I put everything into its own div this made it a lot easier to change and move.

Website design: I wanted to keep it simple so i went with a white background as it makes the black text easy to read. I also decided to use a light colour for the footer and header so it doesn't feel so in your face and the blue colour doesn’t stand out so much. The light blue blends well with the white.

Static Form: To create the static form on the contact me page i used Tom Rose's HTML Form Example. For the static form I just kept it simple and made it the area to email me I got this idea from Joel.sh website as he did the same. I got the styling and how to make it work from Tom Rose’s HTML Form Example which can be found here: http://codepen.io/UoN-ThomasRose/pen/NbYrGj  

What worked well and what didn't:

Positives: Firstly my favourite part of this site is the header and everything in it. It looks simple but the styling and black text is complimented by the light blue background. I really like how this looks and how the navigation bar is offset to the title. I did originally have them aligned so they were nicely centered but i didn't think it looked as good as being offset so I made sure the title was overlapping the CV part of the navigation bar.

I like how clear and easy everything is to read and where each piece of information is placed. I really like the idea of having the index page combine as a content page this helps people know straight away what pages stores what information. I got this idea from Joel.sh website.

The last main positive i wanted to talk about with this site is that i didn't want to go over the top with the images so i put images in when needed and when appropriate so the pages didn't look so clustered. 

Main negatives: To me i liked the idea of the website being simple and clear but i think it may not have enough eye catching features that get people more intrigued in the site. This could have been done with more colour but i would need to test a few colours first to see what goes well with light blue.

I could have also accomplished this with adding a few more icons. The only place i would have implemented this would have been on the index page next to each sub heading but I’m still happy how the page looks without the icons there. 

Another improvement i could have made is to use a different font or colour than the basic font. This would have been done by changing the font-family in the appropriate class. When i first seen the content i was happy with how it looked so I decided I didn’t needed to change it.

Something i would like to of changed is the "Email me here." title to be slightly higher up in the box which would close the gap between itself and the border line.

Timeline:

1 hour: I viewed the Joel.sh website and using this i created the wireframes for my website. The Wireframes show the layout of how i wanted the website to look. I probably should have thought about the colour but because i knew i was using a white background and black text there wasn't much colour to be added. When i put the footer and header in the wireframes i thought the light blue would complement the text and bring a bit of colour which was missing to the website. 

30 minutes: It took about half an hour to set up the repository and make the folder layout. I deleted the previous work because I wanted to start the project fresh.

15 minutes: To lay out the basic code of each of the page so i had the footer and the header put in with a bit of content so that i could see where the paragraphs was showing.
This was to check that the header and footer were set up correctly.

30 minutes: Took me to design and work learn how to create the navigation bar and implement it. I decided to use a horizontal list and none bullet pointed due to looking at Joel.sh home page.
The position of the navigation bar was my idea. i used this W3schools page available here: http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp to get the navigation bar functioning.

1 hour: To implement images on each page. This includes finding the images as i didn't want to use any images that were of me i decided to pull off some copyright free images from Pixabay. 
These images are references below. I added a div to each picture so i could make changes to each picture on its own. 

1 hour: It took me another hour to fill the pages with the right content and to style this. I covered everything on the site in divs so if i wasn’t happy with a picture i could change the div and it will change just that area.

30 minutes: After the content was put in it took me another 30 mins to check the content and all the styling was how I wanted it to be. 

40 minutes: The static form i had to refer back to Tom Rose static form on this one and which is referenced below but can be found here: http://codepen.io/UoN-ThomasRose/pen/NbYrGj. I had a lot of small adjustments to make sure the spacing was equal between the lines. I found this quite challenging to accomplish. 

10 minutes: For sorting out all the validation errors i had the alt tag attribute in images and also the title tag from the head was missing with the help of w3s using the following pages: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_img_alt.asp http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_title.asp
i was able to solve the mistakes that appeared. 

Hours taken: 5:35 (this is constant working on it.)
